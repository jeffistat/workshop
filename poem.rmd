<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
The whiskey stink of rot has settled  
in the garden, and a burst of fruit flies rises  
when I touch the dying tomato plants.  
Still, the claws of tiny yellow blossoms  
flail in the air as I pull the vines up by the roots  
and toss them in the compost.  
It feels cruel. Something in me isn’t ready  
to let go of summer so easily. To destroy  
what I’ve carefully cultivated all these months.
